    Building organizations is in my blood. I come from a very entrepreneurial background, and then started my first company when I was 18. I've experienced some success since, and certainly have fallen on my face a few times as well.

    Since starting at Personify desk has been right next to the CEO's, giving me a front row seat in creating, scaling, and learning to lead a world-class technology company.

    Personify has taken my organization-building skills to a completely new level. And I am absolutely thrilled to help in my small way to use my expertise in tech to help young girls love STEM.
  passion: |
    Quite simply, it's because I have a young daughter, Addy, and she is my whole world. MakerGirl is without question favorite activity. My passion for helping young girls in STEM is a reflection of my little girl's passion for technologically oriented creativity. I want nothing more than to continue to ennoble that in Addy, and others like her.
  advice: |
    I named my son, Soren, after my favorite Philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard. He once wrote, "What if, rather than speaking or dreaming of an absolute beginning, we speak of a leap?” Anything worth doing is going to be harder than you first imagined, and carries the risk of failure. To make a difference in the world, sometimes you just have to take a leap.

    Allan Kay, a researcher in the 1970s at the famous Xerox PARC, put it another way: "Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do…The best way to predict the future is to invent it."

    Being an Innovator when you grow older - inventing the future - is going to be hard. You will fail. But take heart! Always strive to be on the exponential part of a learning curve. Be bold. Be Innovative. Take the leap!

    Teaching this to Addy is why I'm proud that my daughter calls herself a MakerGirl.

    It’s bigger than just increasing the number of women in STEM & STEAM, it’s bigger than changing the ratio of women in venture capital or female CEOS — it’s about channeling the power of being born a woman, with all of its gender constructions and assumptions, into something extraordinary using our consumer power and by supporting other girls, women and feminists. It’s also admitting that girls are dynamic."

    Embrace failure - keep trying until something works. Creativity and tenacity are built through overcoming failure!

    MakerGirl has a strong vision for inspiring girls to be active in STEM.  I hope to use my own technical knowledge as a professional engineer, administrator, and educator to contribute to MakerGirl’s success in achieving this vision.
  passion: |
    I am a proponent of empowering all girls to achieve great things.  Many girls don’t know about the unbelievable opportunities that exist for them if they have an desire to pursue STEM fields.  I want to help ensure they all are exposed to these opportunities so they can set their sights on these goals.
  advice: |
    Always believe in yourself.  Set your goals and then work to achieve them.  If you can dream it, you can achieve it!

  passion: |
    The world has become increasingly dependent on STEM careers, particularly technology, so it's critical that we encourage and inspire the next generation of leaders. As a working mother, I'm passionate about getting more girls interested in STEM because I want my daughter to have a well-rounded education and equal opportunity for advancement in a society that doesn't tend to promote females in these types of roles. Unfortunately, young girls and women are underrepresented in STEM fields.  We need to show them that they are extremely capable if introduced to STEM subjects early on and that they can be important, contributing members of a more innovative and economically competitive world.

    MakerGirl’s mission — and team — are inspiring.  I’ve been lucky to work with them since day zero (or perhaps day -30), both in courses and in the iVenture Accelerator, in which they won a spot (I abstained from voting).

    Humanity has a dazzling array of thorny problems to solve — we need all on hands on deck.
  advice: |
    Ask a million questions!  It will help you learn about people and places and problems that make you feel excited, or mad, or happy, or fascinated.  Then ask grownups to help you find out more.  And you can do a ton all on your own, too.  You’re smart and can do things that matter right now — you don’t have to wait until you’re older!

  passion: |
    I grew up in a small town in Texas where most of the women I looked up to were stay at home Moms.  With so few women in my life to look to for advice around choosing a career, I did what many women do and pursued a career where I knew women who were successful.  I studied Communications at University of Texas where the program was about 90% women.  Many of my fellow female classmates at UT were studying alongside me, or pursuing education or nursing degrees.  As I reflect on my career, I have no regrets but its clear that my lack of exposure to women in STEM fields impacted my choices.  I was always excellent at math, but I didn't see where the opportunities were for me to apply that skill into a long term career.  I think women, especially those in rural areas would be more likely to study STEM fields if they were exposed to women's success stories in those fields, knowledge of the increased wages they might experience in their lifetime in these careers, and real life examples of how exciting those jobs could be.  Women aren't just great educators, medical providers and PR professionals.  They can be great software developers, entrepreneurs and technology innovators.  I want every young girl in the world to know that she has options, and can be whatever she wants to be.
  advice: |
    There so many possibilities when it comes to choosing a career but first its important to get to know yourself.  Find those subjects that you find interesting, or ones that you are naturally really good at.  Where might those things converge into a field of study and where are the top professionals in those fields working?  Do your research and try to talk to as many people as possible about their experiences in those fields.  Soon enough you will likely find something that inspires you.  Don't forget to start early using the tools LinkedIn has built specifically for students around exploring career paths, universities and getting to know the people in your network who can connect you will knowledge and opportunities.
