description: All donations go to fund scholarships for underprivileged girls and will also fund our big goals to reach girls in rural areas who do not have access to STEM-related opportunities.  Paypal is a one-time donation website, and Patreon enables donors to pledge any amount of funds per session.  Absolutely any of your donations are greatly appreciated.  Please e-mail us to ensure that your donation is tax exempt.
