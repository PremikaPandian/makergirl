  info: We are really excited to continue teaching girls about STEM through our unique programs. We will be updating Eventbrite with our new session ideas for different seasons.  When signing up, it is imperative that you complete the Eventbrite (linked in the title of each session) and this UIUC form. It is imperative that you fill out the <a href="https&#58;//illinois.edu/sb/sec/1346930">UIUC form</a> one time for every girl that you sign up. Information about scholarships is given in the UIUC form. Looking forward to seeing you and your MakerGirls!  There are examples of past sessions below.
