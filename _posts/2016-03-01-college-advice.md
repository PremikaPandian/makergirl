Going to college can be one of the scariest thoughts in life your life; having to move away from home; living with a roommate; finding new friends; an deciding what type of career you would like to have.  However college is also one of the best experiences of your life.  On campus there are endless opportunities to get involved and own your time at college.  Weather you love to dance, volunteer, play soccer, learn about new technologies or countless other things, there is always a way to get involved on campus.

Another benefit of getting involved on campus is it allows you the opportunity to explore a lot of your interest in a short amount of time.  This can become very beneficial if you are unsure what you want your major to be; however by joining clubs you are given the opportunity to meet people who have selected that major, and they are able to provide mentorship in helping you finding the right major.  This is very helpful because college can be stressful as time, and having some by your side that has been in the situation before and can provide advice, makes it much more manageable.

Another way to improve your college experience, is do not be afraid to show up to something alone, which is easier said than done. My freshman I did not want to go a club meeting I was very interested in because I did not know anyone else going; I waited until second semester because I did not have the courage to go the first time around.  This club ended up being where I spent a lot of my time and made some of my best friends; however I needed to find the courage to show up by myself.

While all of the fun opportunities are more enjoyable to talk about, at the end of the day college is about finding what you enjoy learning and getting an education.  At times being able to manage everything can be very stressful, and the best thing you can do when you are stressed is ask for help.  Wheatear itâ€™s calling a friend and asking for homework help or sending a teacher an e-mail, asking for help can make hard times much easier.  While teachers may assign a lot of homework, they do not want to see their students struggle; asking for a little bit of help can go a long way.

Some advice that was given to me that I want to pass on to others, is take the time to get to you know teachers; they have a whirlwind of experiences that they love to share with their students, and taking a few minutes out of your day could really help you in finding your passion.

A lastly remember to enjoy yourself; college is a time of trying new things, meeting new people, discovering who you are.  It is some of the best years of your life, which happen to fly by. Be spontaneous, be adventurous, discover yourself, but most importantly be a change maker.
