# Changing Champaign

Growing up in the Champaign-Urbana area, I wasn’t necessary always encouraged to explore the STEM field. Especially coming from a family where higher education wasn’t a common factor between generations, the STEM field wasn’t something my parents felt I needed to be a part of, thus, they never had the need to seek out opportunities for me as a young girl. In school, the word “innovation” wasn’t clearly defined for me or many of my female classmates. When I looked around at my classmates who were actively pursuing their interests within the STEM field, it was primarily boys with a few girls sprinkled into the mix. Regardless, both groups were introduced to the STEM field through parental influence, rather than through the education available in the schools. Therefore, it is so vital to have organizations such as MakerGirl be embedded into the Champaign-Urbana community.

Champaign-Urbana is a unique area that encompasses various types of families. Being located in central Illinois along with having the University of Illinois in the background, the Champaign-Urbana area has the opportunity to be progressive in terms of promoting STEM education for children within the community. Compared to the rest of Illinois, Champaign – Urbana is considered as quite diverse, with the percentage of minorities often exceeding Illinois’s makeup for the state’s population. With such as diverse population, organizations that introduce and foster the interest for STEM fields, such as MakerGirl, has limitless opportunities to create a lasting impact for the generations of children who do not have the chance to understand or apply their interest in STEM.

MakerGirl can promote STEM into a child’s life in a way that not all educators or parental figures can as MakerGirl focuses on the fun behind STEM through the use of 3D printing. It allows participates to create something from their own imagination right on the spot. MakerGirl allows upcoming generations of kids in the Champaign-Urbana community to be exposed to the innovative world of STEM through design, discussion, and creation, regardless of what their pervious knowledge of STEM was. With more and more organizations like MakerGirl, the gap of who represents the STEM field will close. Not only will more females be encouraged to seek out opportunities in STEM but there will also be more diversity in terms of race and socioeconomic backgrounds, especially in Champaign-Urbana.

MakerGirl makes it possible for kids who will become first generation college students to begin thinking about a career in STEM long before they even step foot in a lecture hall. Opportunities in STEM will no longer to be limited to a certain stereotype and as more investment is expanded to a more diverse younger generation, there will be continuous interest in STEM. MakerGirl will help change the faces of STEM starting with kids within the Champaign-Urbana area.
