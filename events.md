# Past Sessions
## Session I
### Clipped to the future
In this session we taught the girls how important STEM is in their lives by 3D printing fun clips for their hair. Everyone got to pick and print a shape and then they were able to decorate it with glitter and rhinestones as they pleased. We were able to show them how printing worked and also were able to teach them about a young woman in STEM, Marita Cheng. She is a founder of two companies that engineer robots for people with disabilities and teach young girls about robotics. The girls were able to learn about new ways they could change the future with STEM while having fun and making a cute clip they can wear!

## Session II
### Make a Name For Yourself
During Make a Name for Yourself, the girls were able to combine their skills from two different software platforms to make name tags for themselves. Using TinkerCAD, the girls learned to import a design and modify it to fit their preferences. Everyone learned how to insert text and other shapes as well as change dimensions of the objects being added. In addition, they learned the capabilities of inserting a solid object and using the different shapes to create holes of the shapes they wanted. After they completed their design, the models were ready to download for 3D printing. The models were prepared for printing using MakerWare. MakerWare was introduced at the first session and many of the girls were starting to become familiar with the software. After preparing the print in MakerWare, their keychains were ready for printing!
